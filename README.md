To run this project locally:
1. Install node.js https://nodejs.org/en/
2. npm install
3. npm run serve
4. Navigate to localhost:8080

Note: Columns should be clicked instead of hovered to display cover images. I went
with this design because when the columns are dense, it is hard to stay hovered 
over the one you want to select.
